Lieber F23: Professor Lieber is a good instructor, but seems to have left UCI. The course content is pretty abstract and will be difficult unless you are very familiar with college-level math, which most people (including math majors) are not when they take this class. As in most math courses, weekly quizzes and homework are graded virtually on completion, and exams are ok. You should understand every concept and theorem introduced, or at least be able to memorize it and connect it to other things you know. Linear algebra is sleeper knowledge for a little bit but gets very important very quickly in upper-division computer science.
