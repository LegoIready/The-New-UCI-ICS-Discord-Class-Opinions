Streets F25: Professor Streets is a good instructor, but I mostly did not attend and usually used only Professor Donaldson’s course notes. Unlike other math courses, there are no weekly quizzes. Analysis is difficult and boring at times, but overall interesting. Skills in abstract math will transfer decently, but it’s much more involved and difficult conceptually than lower-division calculus, for example.
