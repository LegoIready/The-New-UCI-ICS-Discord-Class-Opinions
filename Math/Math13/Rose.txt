Donaldson W24: Professor Donaldson is a little divisive, but I like him a lot. He is a good lecturer, but does go fast and expects kind of a high comprehension speed. That said, the class requires little effort after taking ICS 6B/6D, and is not as good at the concepts that those courses cover. If 13 is the only course you want to take, just take 6B/6D instead. However, if you want to go into higher math, it will probably be a prerequisite and it has a more abstract orientation that I think is more helpful for upper-division courses than 6B/6D. You should use the course notes, but don’t rely on them completely. Like most math courses, weekly quizzes and homework are graded similarly to completion. However, Professor Donaldson’s exams are difficult.
