Reyes S25 (TA: Tianhao Wang): Professor Reyes is a great instructor and enjoys algebra. Unfortunately, this course is only offered once every two years, and only in the spring, so take it when it’s available! The course content is super interesting if you like algebra and it’s more fun than the previous two, with a focus on applications of algebra to other areas in pure math. The course treats less content but the content is harder, so it actually feels the same or harder than the previous two. Assessments were moderately difficult but fair. Tianhao was great.
