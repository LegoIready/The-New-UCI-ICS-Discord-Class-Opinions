Hou F25: Professor Hou is a good instructor but the course design had a bit to be desired (this was his first course as a professor). It is a good introduction to thinking about data analysis. Matlab is easy to learn and the introduction to Numpy and Matplotlib is pretty basic. If you have taken any class that uses Numpy, like CS 177 or 178, then this course requires almost no effort.
