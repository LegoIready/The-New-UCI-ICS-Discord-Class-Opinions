Donaldson F24 (TA: Tianhao Wang): Again, I like Professor Donaldson, he lectures fast, and you should use the course notes but not rely on them completely. This is one of my favorite courses. Most concepts are relevant throughout the course but only about half are in the rest of the series. Exams are difficult. Tianhao was great.
