Jung F24: Professor Jung is a good instructor but it seems he no longer teaches at UCI. The course content is dreadfully boring and the projects are straightforward examples of it. Attendance was required, and did help a bit. If you ever take a course with him, make SURE to cc all course staff when emailing him.
