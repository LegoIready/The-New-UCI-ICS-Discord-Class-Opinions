Haley F23: The course introduces literary analysis through closely guided readings, lectures, and essays, and develops key skills in essay writing. Grades are from essays, exams, and participation. Essays tend to be graded leniently, but exams are a little harder. Dr. Haley is a great instructor and always makes seminar and office hours comfortable and accessible.
