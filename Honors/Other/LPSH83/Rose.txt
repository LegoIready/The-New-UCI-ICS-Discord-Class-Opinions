Stanford S25: The course covers Professor Stanford’s research process on a particular paper about the evolution of human moral psychology. Readings are the sources cited on that paper, and exams are as in H1G. There is a heavy focus on non-technical evolutionary theory and accounts of early human cooperation, and many readings are papers in psychology exploring the applications of these accounts to close primate relatives.
