Barrett and Stanford F24: The course covers philosophical and psychological accounts of epistemology, mainly the problem of scientific induction and Bayesian belief revision. Much of the course focuses on prerequisite concepts that allow understanding those two main items. It is a great survey of the field but still very abstract. Exams are moderately difficult and consist of short essays, and make up most of the grade.
