Xia F24: I’m gonna be honest, I smurfed this class and I don’t know why UCI didn’t accept my AP Physics C credit. The lab portion is fun if you’re partnered with a friend! It’s really a tutorial section, so very little of real experiments and mostly filling out a worksheet. Truly, it is a repeat of high school physics, but more difficult in its problems. If you want to self study, Professor Xia is great.
