Thornton W24: Professor Thornton is currently the only instructor for 33. I did not attend any lectures because they follow his online notes very closely, and I scored about 75% on the final exam (above average). The other part of my grade was problem sets, which were fine, and projects, which were very difficult and prepared me very well for the rest of the programming and algorithms curriculum.
