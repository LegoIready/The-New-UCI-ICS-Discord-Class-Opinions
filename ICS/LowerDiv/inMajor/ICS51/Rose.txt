Dutt S24: Professor Dutt is interested in teaching, but his lectures closely followed the text so I did not attend. The readings are very useful and the course is straightforward if you are able to keep up with readings and the programming projects, which are not as difficult as in other programming courses but still require significant effort. The text is decent, and also teaches material for 53, though it is not used in that course. Course grades were curved bimodally, meaning that a decent number of people received A’s but many people had their grades lowered to C’s. 6B gives a great head start.
