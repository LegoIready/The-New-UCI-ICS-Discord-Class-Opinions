Klefstad S24: Professor Klefstad is considered, by some, the best instructor for 45C. There are weekly quizzes and mostly weekly programming projects. Professor Klefstad’s recommended readings are a curated selection from several online texts, and are immensely helpful for learning the language in combination with the projects. The course is, as other programming courses, very difficult but very useful for learning the language well and deeply.
