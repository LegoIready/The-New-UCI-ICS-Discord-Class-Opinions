Wong-Ma W25: Professor Wong-Ma is not only the only instructor for 53 but one of the best instructors in the department. She follows an active learning model by calling on people in lecture, giving live analogy demonstrations, and occasionally having students volunteer to participate in the demonstrations. I did not use the course text, only lectures. The programming projects are, again, very difficult but very interesting. The exams are fine. This course made me interested in systems programming and design. 51 knowledge is mostly not used.
