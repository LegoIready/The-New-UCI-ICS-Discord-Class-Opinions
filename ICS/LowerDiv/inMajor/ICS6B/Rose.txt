Gassko F23: Professor Gassko is usually considered the most educational and most difficult instructor for 6B. The course is a lot of work but straightforward if you do your best on every reading and assignment. It is a fully flipped course, so lecture times are for in-class activities, and traditional lectures are asynchronous video-quizzes. This is a spectacular course for anyone interested in theory or math. It is front heavy, meaning that it gets easier throughout the quarter. Learning Assistants are very available during lecture and hold their own office hours. The course content is extremely valuable in algorithms and is a better introduction to proofs than the corresponding course in the Math Department.
