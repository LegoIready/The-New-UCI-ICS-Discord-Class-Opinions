Shindler F24: Professor Shindler is a phenomenal instructor. The course was composed of a few exams and mostly weekly programming projects. Professor Shindler uses active learning: lectures are heavily interspersed with short activities that may be completed with other students. The lectures, along with the projects, are much more useful than the Zybooks text. Lectures also contain information that is not in the text, such as explanations of novel data structures like Cuckoo hash tables and crumple trees, which are implemented in projects. Professor Shindler is one of the instructors at UCI whose class I do not want to skip.
