Gassko W24: Professor Gassko is also considered the best and hardest instructor for 6D. The focus of this course is more on computation that in 6B, with fewer new concepts. However, the concepts are more difficult and more prone to mistakes, so diligence in assignments and readings is even more important here. The Learning Assistants follow the same model as in 6B. The course content is very applicable to other areas, especially algorithms, so don’t slack off.
