Dogucu W25: Professor Dogucu is a great instructor and cares very much about students’ success. The course mostly repeats material from AP Statistics, with a few important additions (including likelihood and programming in R, which are not included in the text). Attendance is required, and the course text is mediocre. Homework is easy.
