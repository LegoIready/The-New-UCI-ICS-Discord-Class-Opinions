Shindler F25–S27: Yes! Professor Shindler is a great research advisor, mixing a good amount of freedom and structure, and is a fun and friendly person. He gives good advice about academics and student life, provides encouragement and readings to jump into CS education research, and allows students to have equal input into the projects they work on and control over projects they propose.
