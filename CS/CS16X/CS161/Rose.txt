Shindler S25: Again, Professor Shindler is a phenomenal instructor (the best for 161) and the course follows the same active learning model as 46: lecture mixed with short activities. I did not use the text and only attended lectures, and studied the handouts and slides closely while I was out of town for two weeks. Exams are difficult but fair. The course concepts are pretty good for Leetcode.
