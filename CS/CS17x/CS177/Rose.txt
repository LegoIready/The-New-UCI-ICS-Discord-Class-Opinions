Sudderth F25: Professor Sudderth is a great instructor and the course is quite challenging for an upper-division course, while remaining interesting and straightforward with the readings. I agree, it should be taken by any students interested in theory, similar to 162. The course content reviews 67 in more depth and introduces applications in computer science, notably random algorithms, information theory, and Markov chains. The course is math-heavy but not proofs-based, which lets it introduce advanced stuff in probability theory by relying sort of on intuition.
