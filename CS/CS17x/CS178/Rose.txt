Ahmed S25: Professor Ahmed is a good instructor but, due to personal reasons, I did not attend the course and was fine by studying the lecture slides and doing the homework, which was pretty guided. Exams were somewhat easy. From what I know about other instructors, Professor Ahmed’s course is easier than other offerings of 178 but covers less content.
