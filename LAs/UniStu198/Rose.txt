Gassko S24/W25 (ICS 6B/6D): Irene is a good supervisor and cares about you learning how to teach, while being understanding and facilitative. It is a great first LA course, and you are pretty involved in interacting with students compared to some other courses. You will support students in the in-class activities and hold office hours, among other miscellaneous tasks. The position requires average knowledge of the course content and will help you review the content as the quarter progresses.
